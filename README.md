# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard which allows the user to look up a city's weather forecast which ultimately will display the current weather and a 5-Day forecast. When the current forecast is retrieved, the user is given the temperature, humidity and wind speed. However, when given the 5-Day forecast, the user is given only the temperature and the humidity for those days. Weather icons are also added to give a visual aid for the weather data retrieved.
